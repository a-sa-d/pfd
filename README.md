# Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install flask.

```bash
cd pfd
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from flask import Flask
```
